# Flow based consistencies for self-supervised vessel segmentation

This is the code for the MICCAI 2021 paper.


### Important files:
* `get_all_metrics_drivestare.py` : Contains code for obtaining evaluation metrics on the DRIVE and STARE datasets. Compares with other 2D vesselness methods. Contains code for obtaining similar metrics for bifurcation locations (locations are annotated manually).
* `get_all_metrics_hrf.py` : Similar as before, but for the HRF dataset.


Note that file names need to be changed at a lot of places.

TODO:
* Update README
* Document code
